# Waterloo-University-Project
For this project, I analyzed student enrollment and demographic data from the University of Waterloo, using fields like Fiscal Year, Term Type, Career, Program Level, Study Year, Campus, Faculty Group, Program Grouping, Coop Regular, Work Term, Attendance, Visa Status, and Student Headcounts. My analysis aimed to provide insights into enrollment trends across faculties, the distribution of co-op vs. regular students, and the impact of international student attendance.

Key tasks included:

Data Cleaning: Standardized the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency across multiple academic terms and program levels.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns in student headcounts based on program and faculty grouping, as well as differences between co-op and regular streams.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) to illustrate enrollment trends, study year progression, and campus-based distribution.
This project enhanced my skills in data wrangling, trend analysis, and visualization, allowing me to interpret and communicate complex data effectively.
