# Waterloo-University-Project
 I analyzed student enrollment and demographic data from the University of Waterloo, using fields like Fiscal Year, Term Type, Career, Program Level, Study Year, Coop Regular, Work Term, Visa Status. etc. My analysis aimed to provide insights into enrollment trends across faculties, the distribution of co-op vs. regular students. etc.
